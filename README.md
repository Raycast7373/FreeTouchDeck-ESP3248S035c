# FreeTouchDeckWT32
This is a port of Dustin Watt's FreeTouchDeck project (https://github.com/DustinWatts/FreeTouchDeck.git) to the to the WT32-SC01 integrated ESP32, LCD, and capacitive touch screen board. 

Other than adapting to the board, My hope was to allow more buttons per page  - the screen area is just a bit smaller than the size of twelve StreamDeck buttons which seems reasonable. The code now has an array of  Menus (pages).  Each Menu has a 2D array of Buttons, each Button has an array of 3 Actions, etc.  The code ends up addressing a specific button with something like "menu[pageNum].button[row][col].islatched = true;" Rather than a dedicated home page and a dedicated return to home in the bottom right of each page each button on each page can be modified, and in principle any page could call any other. At the time of writing this file the code loadd the buttons and pages, and they run, but I know nothing about HTML or JS so the configurator has me running in circles as I try to it out. For the moment you need to manually code the json files for each page.
